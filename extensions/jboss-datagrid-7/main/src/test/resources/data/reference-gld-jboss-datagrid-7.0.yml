#
# A sample GLD configuration file that configures the load driver to send traffic into a JBoss DataGrid 7 instance
#
# Can be used right away, and it assumes there is a JDG 7 instance listening hotrod on localhost:11222 (and possibly
# on localhost:11422, though the example should work even if it does not listen on the second port). The instance
# must have been previously configured with a "novaordis" cache under the "clustered" cache container:
#
#  gld -c ~/projects/gld/extensions/jboss-datagrid-7/main/src/test/resources/data/reference-gld-jboss-datagrid-7.0.yml
#
# The reference/example configuration/example is available here:
# https://kb.novaordis.com/index.php/Jboss-datagrid-7_Gld_Extension
