            dependencies of io.novaordis.gld.extensions.jboss-datagrid:jboss-datagrid-common, which was NOT declared as
            <provided> because we needed its dependencies during compilation and testing. Those libraries, which are
            the GLD API and *its* dependencies, will already be available in the runtime.
